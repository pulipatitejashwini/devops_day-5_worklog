# TASK 5: Process Management in Linux

## Overview
This task focuses on understanding and managing Linux system processes.            
It covers listing running processes, monitoring system resource usage, managing services using systemctl, and controlling processes using kill commands.     

Process management is a critical skill for DevOps and Cloud Engineers to ensure system stability, performance, and availability.

## Tools Used
- Linux Command Line (CLI)          
- systemctl (Service Management)             
- ps, top, kill, kill -9, free -m, uptime

## What I Did
- Installed **Nginx** as a sample service to understand service management             
- Listed running processes using `ps` and `top`             
- Monitored CPU, memory, and disk usage                 
- Identified different Linux process states               
- Killed running processes using `kill` and `kill -9`           
- Checked service status using `systemctl`             
- Started and stopped the Nginx service          
- Enabled Nginx service to start automatically at boot                
- Recorded observations and system behavior
